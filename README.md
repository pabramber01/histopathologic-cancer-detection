The objective of this work is to carry out an analysis of the data collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection) with the intention of making a predictive model.

All the work done can be found inside the histopathologic_cancer_detection/ folder or on the web via the following link:

- https://pabramber01.github.io/histopathologic-cancer-detection

If you want to run the code locally, you must download the input data from the Kaggle link above and put it in the histopathologic_cancer_detection/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection/ folder.
